    <h2>Lasagna</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>olive oil cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 zucchini, sliced</li>
        <li>2 green bell peppers, cut in 1-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 onion, cut into 8 wedges</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, pressed</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) jars pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a large baking sheet with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Arrange zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, and onion wedges on prepared baking sheet. Scatter basil and garlic over vegetables and spray with cooking spray. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are lightly browned and tender, 10 to 25 minutes</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Bring pasta sauce to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Mix mozzarella cheese and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/3 cup pasta sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer 3 lasagna noodles over sauce. Spread about of 1/4 the roasted vegetables over noodles and top with about 1/4 the sauce. Sprinkle 1/4 of the mozzarella-Parmesan cheese mixture over the sauce. Repeat layers 3 more times, ending with the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbly, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
